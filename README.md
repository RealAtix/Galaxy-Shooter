Galaxy Shooter
================================

*This game isn't really something special or unique but it was fun to make.*

I had to make something in Javascript that used the following:

* Nested conditional structures
* Nested loops
* Arrays
* Functions with paramaters and return values

The goal of the game
-------------------------

There are 5 levels, each level everything goes faster. (Try to beat my score of 24.4k :P )
You lose a life each time a comet touches the left border.

Controls
-------------------------

Arrow keys or wasd to move.
Spacebar to shoot.

If the sound annoys you type the following in the console (ctrl + shift + j in Chrome on Windows)

1. Start screen:
       
        audioStart.pause();
